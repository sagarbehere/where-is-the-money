# where-is-the-money
A bunch of scripts to read financial transactions in OFX format, autocategorize them, and upload them to Google sheets

See this blog post for more details: https://sagar.se/blog/where-is-the-money/

NOTES:

- This code is **absolutely terrible**. I barely know any Python and just copy/pasted random code from StackOverflow and the Internet and hacked till it did what I needed. Once that happened, I stopped working on it immediately :D
- You will not be able to use the code/scripts. There's too little information on how to do that. Rather, read it to understand what your own version of these scripts could be like.
- If you have any particular questions about the code or how something works, please ask me (my email is on my website: https://sagar.se ). I'd be happy to shed more light on how it works.
- If enough requests are made, I'll consider brushing up my Python knowledge, updating this code to make it more generically useful and with some more error checking, and documenting it along with usage instructions.
